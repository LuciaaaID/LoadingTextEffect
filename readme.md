Loading Text Effect
This is a simple JavaScript script to create a loading text effect on an HTML page. The script dynamically adds a "Loading..." text to the page and periodically updates it to simulate a loading process. Once the loading process is completed, the text is removed, and the actual content is displayed.

Usage
Include the index.js file in your HTML file.
The script will automatically add the loading text to the page when it is loaded.
Adjust the loading duration in the script if needed.
Replace the loading text with your actual content once the loading process is complete.
